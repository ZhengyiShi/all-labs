### **2. Why it is important to choose a license?**
Without a license, using software may constitute a breach of copyright laws. And a license can explain to users what they can do and what they can't. Difference licenses also have difference permissions and restrictions.

### **3. Why it is important that you should not use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**
Using a project that doesn't have an explicit license may leave ourselves liable to a potential lawsuit. We may violet some restrictions due to the implicit license. So we should be careful about the license.

### **4. Do you agree the web beats Gopher?**
Yes, I agree about it. In both cases, the Web did better than the Gopher. The Web developers release their software to the public early in the process to gain adherents and then let a larger development community make improvements to the code while the Gophers put too much burden on themselves.

### **5. Why Microsoft .NET Core chooses MIT license?**
Microsoft .NET Core is a kind of cross-platform application framework. It should provide a freedom environment to developers without many limitation. And  MIT license lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable. Thus Microsoft .NET Core chooses MIT license.

### **6. Think of an example project and pick a license.**
We want to write a _**web crawler**_ to help you search pictures, articles or videos on facebook or youtube according to the key words. People can use this _**web crawler**_ to find things they are interested in. We may use MIT license of this project because it isn't for commercial use and we think _**web crawler**_ will be easier to improve in this way.

### **7. Read licenses.**
GPL: You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.

LGPL: This license is mainly applied to libraries. You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described and licensed for free under LGPL. Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the library don't have to be.

BSD: The BSD 3-clause license allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright and license notice in it.


### **9. Choose a project.**
We want to write a _**web crawler**_ to help you search pictures, articles or videos on facebook or youtube according to the key words. People can use this _**web crawler**_ to find things they are interested in. We may use MIT license of this project because it isn't for commercial use and we think _**web crawler**_ will be easier to improve in this way.
